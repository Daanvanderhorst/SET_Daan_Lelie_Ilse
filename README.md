# SET_Daan_Lelie_Ilse
This project was started as the final project for our programming in mathematics course.
We had to learn a lot to make this happen. First we had to learn how classes worked and what you could do with them. But after some time experimenting we began to understand how it could be used and how usefull it was. Secondly was pygame and its helpful but also overbearing amount of functions. It really is a nice tool that makes displaying things way easier than in normal python. Thirdly was how the big while loop for the graphics and events worked. We struggled a bit with displaying things that changed over time, they overlapped the previous things but it was still there. Eventually we figured out how te clear the screen every frame and solved it.
There are three files here: Classes contains the class Card that gets used all over the project. Comparison contains the funcions that if sets are valid and if there are sets in a given list of cards. Pygame contains the main game loop and all the functions that have to do withh displaying the game and the things that happen behind the scenes to make that all happen. Variables above, functions in the middle and the screen loop at the end.
To try the project open the pygame file and run it, make sure you have pygame installed. The window should appear after a few seconds.
